    "about": "This project utilizes OpenZeppelin's ERC721 contract template to create a Solidity smart contract with a small adition that limits users to mint up to 10,000 images as NFTs. Deployed on the Polygon mainnet, this platform offers an affordable and interactive experience for users. <br /><br /> The frontend is developed using Next.js and TypeScript, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the application. Users can easily connect their MetaMask wallets via the Ethereum window object and proceed to mint their images. Image uploading and pinning are handled securely through Pinata's API, ensuring that images are permanently stored on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). <br /><br /> After entering all necessary metadata, users can mint their NFTs directly through the smart contract and seamlessly store them on the blockchain. The application leverages Wagmi for efficient and reliable blockchain transactions. <br /><br /> This project not only offers a practical application of blockchain technology but also provides a platform for users to engage with digital asset creation and management.",

    "about": "This project was inspired by my own need to better predict my future financial situation and after many attempts to teach my girlfriend how I think about money, I decided to pivot the project to be more educational. My approach is a visual and interactive type of app, where the user adjusts a colorful bar that represents your monthly income. Below are two graphs representing real time calculations of these two accounts future outlook. When the user adjusts the income allocation, a new graph is created which diverges from the old to show the consequences of the changes.",
