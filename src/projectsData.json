My approach is a visual and interactive type of app, where the user adjusts a colorful bar that represents your monthly income. Below are two graphs representing real time calculations of these two accounts future outlook. When the user adjusts the income allocation, a new graph is created which diverges from the old to show the consequences of the changes.",

        "result": "",
        "future": "In the future it will be possible to add monetary goals, so a user can plan for bigger purchases such as a car. The idea is to show what such a purchase costs, not only in todays money, but what it will cost the user in the future, if the money is taken away from i.e. the investment account.",

From here you will always be able to see my latest achievements and personal projects.<br /><br /> The project consists of a simple React Single Page Application (SPA), built with Vite and hosted on Netlify. As a fun addition I have created a PDF version of my resume that dynamically updates to reflect the latest content from my resume page. When you download my resume, it is freshly generated using Puppeteer on a cloud server hosted at fly.io inside a secure Docker container. The server is secured with basic authentication to prevent unauthorized access and CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) setup to allow secure web interactions. Feel free to explore the server code on my GitHub page: <a href='https://github.com/lindjacob/cvtopdf'><u>https://github.com/lindjacob/cvtopdf</u></a>.",
