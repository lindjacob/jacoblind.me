        "about": "This project was inspired by my own need to better predict my future financial situation and after many attempts to teach my girlfriend how I think about money, I decided to pivot the project to be more educational. My approach is a visual and interactive type of app, where the user adjusts a colorful bar that represents your monthly income. Below are two graphs representing real time calculations of these two accounts future outlook. When the user adjusts the income allocation, a new graph is created which diverges from the old to show the consequences of the changes.",
        "goal": "The goal is to give a visual understanding for budgeting and teach the user how to financially plan for the future.",
        "result": "",
        "future": "In the future it will be possible to add monetary goals, so a user can plan for bigger purchases such as a car. The idea is to show what such a purchase costs, not only in todays money, but what it will cost the user in the future, if the money is taken away from i.e. the investment account.",

The idea was to showcase some of my skills working with React and APIs in as simple a setup as possible. The app has no server side, so fetching an API-token from Spotify and using it in a seamless way, is done by saving the values in the browser's local storage.",
