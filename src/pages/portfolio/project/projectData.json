        "about": "This project was inspired by my own need to better predict my future financial situation. But after many attempts to teach my girlfriend how I think about money, I decided to pivot the project to be more educational. My educational approach is a visual and interactive type of app, where the user adjusts a colorful bar that represents one months income. Below two graphs represent real time calculations of these two accounts future outlook. When the user adjusts the income allocation, a new graph is created which diverges from the old to show the consequences of the changes.",
        "goal": "The goal is to give a visual understanding for how much the user spends each month compared to how much is put aside into savings and investments.",
        "result": "",
        "future": "In the future it will be possible to add monetary goals, so a user can plan for bigger purchases such as a car. The idea is to show what such a purchase costs, not only in todays money, but what it will cost the user in the future, if the money is taken away from i.e. the investment account.",
        "collaborations": "The designs for this project were done by Caterina Pomari."
